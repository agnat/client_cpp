Ohai. I'm still playing around with this code. Don't use
it. Eventually this will become a client library for C++ for
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). If you'd like to contribute, pull
requests are welcome but be aware that I'm still changing the overall
structure of the code every other day, so feel free to [email
me](mailto:korfuri@gmail.com) first to discuss your idea.

# Dependencies

[Bazel](http://bazel.io)

The workspace will pull:
  * gtest
  * protobuf
  * client_model
